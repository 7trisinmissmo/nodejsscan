Here are some of the cricket batting tips in Tamil pdf 26 that you can learn from:
 
- Grip your bat properly. If you are right-handed, place your left hand on top of the handle towards the toe (the rounded tip of the bat) with your right hand under it. If you are left-handed, do the opposite. Your thumbs and forefingers should form a "V" between the outside edge and center of the bat that points towards the toe of the bat.[^5^]
- Assume the proper stance. Stand sideways in the crease (the "safe" area in front of the wicket) with your shoulder facing the bowler (who "pitches" the ball). Look straight over your shoulder towards the bowler and do not tilt your head. Spread your feet about 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart and bend your knees slightly with your weight distributed evenly on both legs. Rest the toe of the bat on the ground behind your feet near the wicket; your top hand will rest on the inside of your thigh nearest the bowler.[^5^]
- Watch the ball closely as it crosses the pitch to determine which type of shot you need to play. The batting action in cricket has more in common with a tight, controlled golf swing than the wide, horizontal arc of a baseball bat.[^7^]
- Shift your weight to your back foot for longer pitches (ones that bounce farther away from you) and to your front foot for shorter pitches (ones that bounce closer to you). This will help you adjust to the bounce and speed of the ball.[^5^]
- Swing the bat properly. When the ball is pitched, roll your shoulder facing the bowler down slightly and swing the bat backwards in a straight line. Use your top hand for control as you bring the bat forward to meet the ball.[^5^] The back-swing provides the power for the shot; a good swing clears the top of the wicket.
- Follow through to get more distance on your shot. After hitting the ball, continue to swing the bat until it reaches over your opposite shoulder. This will help you transfer more momentum to the ball and send it farther.[^7^]
- Decide whether to attempt to score a run or continue batting. A successful batsman knows when to try to score and when to remain in position and defend the wicket. If there is no time to switch places with the other batsman (the non-striker) and score a run, stay put and prepare for the next shot.[^5^]
- Practice your footwork against fast bowlers and spinners. Fast bowlers deliver the ball at high speed and try to make it swing or seam (move sideways in the air or off the pitch). Spinners deliver the ball at slower speed and try to make it spin (change direction after bouncing on the pitch). You need to practice different types of footwork to deal with different types of bowlers.[^6^]
- Learn methods to keep your nerves under control. Batting can be stressful, especially when facing fast bowlers or when chasing a big target. You need to learn how to calm yourself down and focus on each ball. Some methods that can help you are breathing exercises, positive self-talk, visualization, and listening to music.[^6^]
